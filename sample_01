üîß 1. In Software Development (especially on GitHub)

A fork is a copy of a repository.
It lets you freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

You can fork someone else‚Äôs code, make changes, and even propose your changes back to the original via a pull request.

Common in open source collaboration.

Example:
You find a project on GitHub and click "Fork" to copy it to your account. You now have your own version to work on.

üíª 2. In Operating Systems (like Unix/Linux)

In programming, especially in C or Unix-based systems, fork() is a system call that creates a new process.

The new process is called a child process.

It‚Äôs an almost exact copy of the calling (parent) process.

Example (C):

pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    // This is the child process
} else {
    // This is the parent process
}

üåê 3. In Blockchain / Cryptocurrency

A fork refers to a change or split in a blockchain protocol.

Soft fork: Backward-compatible change

Hard fork: Not backward-compatible; creates two separate chains

Example:
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash split due to a hard fork.
